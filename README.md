# Fantasy Golf App - Sleeper.com Clone (In Progress)

## Summary

This project was built as part of The Odin Project Fullstack JavaScript Curriculum. The objective of this project was to clone our favorite website to practice the fullstack JavaScript skillset we have learned throughout the coursework. I chose to create a clone of [Sleeper.com](https://sleeper.com/) which is one of my favorite fantasy football applications. To add my own twist to this project I chose to apply a fantasy golf theme instead of a football theme. The finished project will be a fullstack application that allows users to play a season long PGA Tour based fantasy golf game with other users.
