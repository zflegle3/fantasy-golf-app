# Fantasy Golf App - Sleeper Clone (In Progress)

[Live Demo Here!](https://zflegle3.github.io/to-do-list/)

## Summary

This project was built as part of The Odin Project JavaScript curriculum. The objective of this project was to clone our favorite website to practice the JavaScript skills we have learned throughout the coursework. I chose to create a clone of [Sleeper.com](https://sleeper.com/) which is a fantasy football app but to apply a golf theme to the project. The finished project will be a fullstack application that allows users to play a seasson long PGA Tour based fantasy golf game.
